## Phase 1 — Core Shift Scheduler (MVP Priority)

> **Goal:** A working shift scheduling system where managers create places, register workers with skills, define coverage needs, workers submit availability, the solver generates schedules, and managers publish them. This is the primary problem we are solving.

### 1.1 Auth & User Management

- [X] Company Admin can create a company + first Manager account (§3.1)
- [X] Manager login with email + password
- [x] Worker login with email OTP (§10.1)
- [X] Rate limiting and OTP TTL enforcement
- [X] User profile page — worker can view/edit limited personal details (§10.9)
- [X] RLS policies enforce company isolation on all tables (§15.1)

### 1.2 Place Setup (Manager)

- [x] CRUD places (name, address) (§7.1)
- [X] Place scheduling settings: granularity, min/max hours per day, block limits, rest between shifts (§7.5)
- [x] Global skills catalog — Manager can create/edit skill names (§7.2)
- [ ] Place skills config — enable skills per place, `enforceMinTeamRating` toggle + optional `minAvgRating` (§7.3)

### 1.3 Worker Management (Manager)

- [X] CRUD workers: name, email, status (INVITED/ACTIVE/DISABLED) (§7.6)
- [x] Assign workers to places (place scope: ALL or selected) (§7.6)
- [X] Assign skills to workers with rating per skill (§7.6)
- [X] Set worker `canOpen` and `canClose` flags (§7.6)
- [x] Set worker hourly rate (§7.6)
- [X] Set worker start date (solver eligibility) (§7.6)

### 1.4 Coverage Templates (Manager)

- [ ] Weekly coverage template per place + skill (§7.4)
- [ ] Define: dayOfWeek, startTime, endTime, minCount, maxCount
- [ ] Multiple windows per day per skill supported
- [ ] No overlap validation within same skill/day/place

### 1.5 Availability Submission (Worker)

- [ ] Worker submits availability: full-day, time-range, or vacation flag (§10.5)
- [ ] Availability restricted to published schedule horizon only (§10.5)
- [ ] Calendar UI for selecting dates and time ranges

### 1.6 Schedule Generation (Solver Integration)

- [ ] Manager selects date range and triggers "Generate Schedule" (§8.1)
- [ ] Backend builds solver request from: workers (+ `can_open`/`can_close`), skills, coverage templates, availability, place settings, place+skill constraints
- [ ] Call Python CP-SAT solver service `/solve` endpoint (§5.2)
- [ ] Receive assignments + diagnostics (coverage gaps, constraint violations)
- [ ] Store result as DRAFT schedule
- [ ] Display draft to Manager in day/week view

### 1.6a Solver v2 — Flexible Shift Model (§9.3)

> **Must land before any schedule generation UI is shipped.** This replaces the v1 atomic-window assignment model.

**Core model rewrite (`solver/main.py` — `_solve_cpsat` and `_solve_greedy`):**

- [ ] Convert coverage windows to slot-demand map: `required_workers[day, skill, slot]` using `granularity_minutes`
- [ ] Generate candidate shifts per `(worker, day, skill)`: all `(start, end)` pairs where `minShiftMinutes ≤ end−start ≤ maxShiftMinutes`, start/end snap to granularity, and interval fits worker availability
- [ ] Decision variable `x[worker, day, skill, start, end]` ∈ {0,1}
- [ ] Hard constraint: for each slot, `sum(covering shifts)` + slack ≥ `required_workers[slot]`
- [ ] Hard constraint: `sum(x for worker on day across all skills)` ≤ 1 (one shift per day)
- [ ] Hard constraint: shift must not overlap worker unavailability
- [ ] Hard constraint: locked existing assignments fixed to their exact `(start, end)`
- [ ] Hard constraint: slot-level min average rating per place+skill when enabled (`rating_sum_scaled >= min_avg_scaled * assigned_count`) — applies to single-worker and multi-worker slots
- [ ] Hard constraint: if a day has assignments, earliest starter group must include at least one `can_open=true` worker
- [ ] Hard constraint: if a day has assignments, latest finisher group must include at least one `can_close=true` worker

**Objective (priority order):**

- [ ] P1: Minimize coverage gap penalty — weight 1000 per uncovered slot-worker unit
- [ ] P2: Balance hours proportional to availability — compute each worker's available minutes in horizon; target share = `available_i / sum(available_all)`; penalize deviation from target (weight 50)
- [ ] P3: Prefer longer shifts — penalize `(maxShiftMinutes − actual_shift_minutes)` per assignment (weight 1)
- [ ] P4: Minimize changes vs existing assignments during repair (weight 5 per removed assignment)

**Greedy fallback update:**

- [ ] Greedy: for each worker/day/skill, pick the longest valid shift (respecting min/max) that covers the most uncovered demand slots; track slot coverage and skip already-filled slots

**API contract (no breaking changes):**

- [ ] Rename `min_hours_per_block` → `min_shift_minutes` and `max_hours_per_block` → `max_shift_minutes` in `PlaceSettings` (keep old names as aliases for backwards compat)
- [ ] `Assignment` response already carries free `start_minutes`/`end_minutes` — no schema change needed
- [ ] Update `process-deadline/route.ts` to pass `min_shift_minutes` / `max_shift_minutes` from place settings
- [ ] Update `process-deadline/route.ts` to pass worker `can_open`/`can_close` and `skill_constraints` from `place_skill_configs`

**Regression tests (`solver/test_solver.py` — new tests):**

- [ ] T-F1: Cross-window shift — single shift 10:00–18:00 correctly satisfies 08:00–13:00 and 13:00–18:00 demand windows
- [ ] T-F2: Partial availability handoff — worker A available 09:00–13:30, worker B 13:30–16:00; solver assigns two shifts covering a 09:00–16:00 window
- [ ] T-F3: Min-length fallback — 4-worker day with only 2h of demand left; solver assigns a `minShiftMinutes` shift rather than leaving a gap
- [ ] T-F4: Long-shift preference — when two plans are equally valid, solver prefers the one with longer shifts
- [ ] T-F5: Max-1-shift-per-day preserved — worker with availability across 3 coverage windows gets exactly 1 shift
- [ ] T-R1: Rating threshold single-worker slot — worker below threshold is not scheduled when enforcement is enabled
- [ ] T-R2: Rating threshold multi-worker average — group assignment allowed when average meets threshold
- [ ] T-R3: Rating enforcement disabled — low-rated worker can be scheduled
- [ ] T-R4: Locked low-rated assignment under enforced threshold is INFEASIBLE
- [ ] T-O1: `can_open` enforced — day opener must include at least one `can_open=true`
- [ ] T-C1: `can_close` enforced — day closer must include at least one `can_close=true`

### 1.7 Schedule Publish & History

- [ ] Manager can publish a draft schedule (§8.3)
- [ ] Publishing overwrites PUBLISHED assignments only within draft interval
- [ ] Each publish creates an immutable history record (§4.5)

- [ ] Manager: day view — Gantt-chart: roles on Y-axis, time on X-axis, worker bars (§ wireframes)
- [ ] Worker: planning calendar — month view, tap day to see blocks + coworkers (§10.4)

### 1.10 Notifications (In-App — MVP)

---

## Phase 6 — Leave / Vacation Management

> **Goal:** Workers request leave, managers approve, balance is tracked with automatic accrual.

### 6.1 Leave Requests

---

## Phase 7 — Schedule Overrides & Repair

> **Goal:** Manager can manually adjust schedules and the system revalidates.

- [ ] Manual assign/unassign worker to a block (§8.4)
- [ ] Lock/unlock assignments (locked = solver must keep) (§8.4)
- [ ] Draft revalidation after any override (§8.5)
- [ ] If invalid: draft status = INVALID, publish disabled, diagnostics shown

## Appendix: Dead Code Cleanup

The following legacy items should be cleaned up (see migration `018_cleanup_dead_tables.sql`):

**Tables dropped:**

- `positions` (replaced by `skills`)
- `shift_timeframes`, `shift_slots`, `worker_shift_assignments` (replaced by `schedule_templates` flow)
- `shift_interests` (unused)
- `timesheets`, `timesheet_edits` (unused — hours tracked via `work_sessions`)
- `documents` (feature on hold)

**Dead columns removed:**

- `users.position_id`

**Legacy API routes to remove:**

- `app/api/schedules/solve/route.ts` — uses dead `schedules`/`shifts` tables
- `app/api/schedules/publish/route.ts` — uses dead `schedules`/`shifts`/`schedule_history` tables
- `app/api/timesheets/route.ts` — uses dead `timesheets` table

**Active scheduling flow:**

- `schedule_templates` → `shift_templates` → `worker_availability_submissions` → solver → publish
